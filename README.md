The champagneZwick1121 package is designed to offer efficient solutions for calculating the volume of champagne glasses using various vectorization techniques in R. This package implements different approaches, including for loops, apply functions, and direct vectorization, providing users with a comprehensive comparison of their performance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of champagneZwick1121 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ptds2023/champagneZwick1121")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(champagneZwick1121)

# Example of calculating the volume using a for loop implementation
result_for_loop <- f_for_loop(x)

# Vectorized approach
result_vectorized <- f_vectorized(x)

# Simulate Party
party_simulation <- simulate_party(x)

```
